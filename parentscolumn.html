     	<p>Hygiene are those conditions and pratices that preserve health</p>
	<p>Personal hygiene is very necessary to be taught to every child.</p>
	<p>Cleanliness they say is next to godliness,
	 Parents should teach their children the necessary hygienic pratice that is suited for them at each level</p>
	<p>Hygienic pratices include;
<ol>
<li>Cultivate in the attitude of bathing Regularly</li>
<li>Washing of hands before and after going to toliet</li>
<li>Brushing of teeth every atleast once a day</li>
<li>Triming of nails</li>
<li>Put on clean underwears and clothes everyday.</li>

    Give your child water and plain milk instead of sugary drinks. After the first year, when your nursing toddler is eating more and different solid foods, breast milk is still an ideal addition to his diet.
    Your toddler might become a very picky and erratic eater. Toddlers need less food because they dont grow as fast. Its best not to battle with him over this. Offer a selection of healthy foods and let him choose what she wants. Keep trying new foods; it might take time for him to learn to like them.
    Limit screen time. For children younger than 2 years of age, the AAP recommends that its best if toddlers not watch any screen media.
    Your toddler will seem to be moving continually running, kicking, climbing, or jumping. Let him be active hes developing his coordination and becoming strong.
    Make sure your child gets the recommended amount of sleep each night: For toddlers 1-2 years, 11 to 14 years hours per 24 hours (including naps)

     	<p>Evil communication corrupts good manners,it is said that ones association determines their assimilation.
Any company or association that does not bring growth or improvement should not be permitted to continue, if not,it will make the child redundant or stagnant in life.
Parents should have a close monitor on their children on the kind of friends they keep and the influence of those children on their kids
    <li> Read to your toddler daily.
    Ask her to find objects for you or name body parts and objects.
    Play matching games with your toddler, like shape sorting and simple puzzles.
    Encourage him to explore and try new things.
    Help to develop your toddlers language by talking with her and adding to words she starts. For example, if your toddler says baba, you can respond, Yes, you are right?that is a bottle.
    Encourage your childs growing independence by letting him help with dressing himself and feeding himself.
    Respond to wanted behaviors more than you punish unwanted behaviors (use only very brief time outs). Always tell or show your child what she should do instead.
    Encourage your toddlers curiosity and ability to recognize common objects by taking field trips together to the park or going on a bus ride.
Do NOT leave your toddler near or around water (for example, bathtubs, pools, ponds, lakes, whirlpools, or the ocean) without someone watching her. Fence off backyard pools. Drowning is the leading cause of injury and death among this age group.
Block off stairs with a small gate or fence. Lock doors to dangerous places such as the garage or basement.
Ensure that your home is toddler proof by placing plug covers on all unused electrical outlets.
Keep kitchen appliances, irons, and heaters out of reach of your toddler. Turn pot handles toward the back of the stove.
Keep sharp objects such as scissors, knives, and pens in a safe place.
Lock up medicines, household cleaners, and poisons.
Do NOT leave your toddler alone in any vehicle (that means a car, truck, or van) even for a few moments.

     	<p>Research tells us that to raise a self-reliant child with high self-esteem, it is more effective to be authoritative than authoritarian. You want your child to listen, respect and trust you rather than fear you. You want to be supportive, but not a hovering, helicopter parent. 

All of these things are easy to set as goals, but hard to achieve. How do you find the right balance? 

As your child develops, the challenges will change, and your thinking may evolve, but your approach should be consistent, firm and loving. Help your child learn through experience that making an effort builds confidence and helps you learn to tackle challenges. Calibrate your expectations about what your child is capable of doing independently, whether you have an infant learning to sleep through the night, a toddler helping to put toys away, or an older child resolving conflicts. 

Remember, there is no one right way to raise a child. Do your best, trust yourself and enjoy the company of the small person in your life. </p>
How to Discipline

Small children are essentially uncivilized, and part of the job of parenting inevitably involves a certain amount of correctional work. With toddlers, you need to be patient and consistent, which is another way of saying you will need to express and enforce the same rules over and over and over again. Time outs work very effectively with some children, and parents should watch for those moments when they (the parents) may need them as well. Seriously, take a breather when you are feeling as out of control as your child is acting. 

Distraction is another good technique; you dont have to win a moral victory every time a small child misbehaves if you can redirect the behavior and avoid the battle. The overall disciplinary message to young children is the message that you don’t like the behavior, but you do love the child.

Think praise rather than punishment. Physical discipline, like hitting and spanking, tends to produce aggressive behavior in children. Keep in mind that its always a parental win if you can structure a situation so that a child is earning privileges (screentime, for example) by good behavior, rather than losing them as a penalty. Search for positive behaviors to praise and reward, and young children will want to repeat the experience. But inevitably, parenthood involves a certain number of bad cop moments, when you have to say no or stop and your child will be angry at you  and thats fine, it goes with the territory. Look in the mirror and practice saying what parents have always said: Im your motherfather, Im not your friend. 

As parents, we should be trying to regulate our childrens behavior or to help them regulate their own and not trying to legislate their thoughts: 

    It is O.K. to dislike your brother or your classmate, but not to hit him. 
    It is O.K. to feel angry or frustrated, as long as you behave properly. 

Our civilizing job as parents may be easier, in fact, if we acknowledge the strength of those difficult emotions, and celebrate the child who achieves control. And take advantage of the opportunity to demonstrate what you do when you have lost control or behaved badly: Offer a sincere parental apology.
